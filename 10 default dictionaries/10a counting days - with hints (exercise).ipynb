    "# HINT: SPLITTING CELLS\n",
    "typically in class, we write a lot of code in one cell, and we add #comments to it. When we then run a cell, all the code in that cell is executed. This is fine when there is not that much code in a cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "with a challenge like this one, there are several steps you need to complete. Each step is a series of calculations. It is easier if you split your code across cells: if each cell contains one step, or even one little calculation. That way when you run just that one cell, you can see if your piece of code is working (instead of running all the code, all the time). \n",
    "\n",
    "so the hints below are split into cells, step-by-step. \n",
    "\n",
    "when you execute a cell, JupyterNotebooks remembers the output: so if you define a variable in cell1, and then run that cell: your variable will still be available to you in cell5, etc. "
