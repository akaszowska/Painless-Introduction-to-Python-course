# Painless Introduction to Python: a course
Hi all! 
Welcome to the _Painless Introduction to Python_, a basic course for those who have no to very little experience with programming, but what to see what the fuss is all about. 

The course focuses on [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.5, and relies on [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Notebook (or Google Collaboratory). Python is one of the most popular programming languages. A programming language is any set of rules and instructions forcomputers to complete tasks and manipulate information. Different programming languages have different applications and fit different needs. Weare focusing on Python, because it is versatile, very widely used, and has a large library of functionalities as well as a huge online supportcommunity, which makes it a great first programming language to learn. Programming languages are somewhat separate from IDEs (Integrated Development Environments), which are software applications that are used for writing, editing, and debugging code. 

If you've never worked with Jupyter Notebook before, there are many excellent guides online, for example [here](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/), or you can go straight to [user documentation here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html/). 

This course is **fully self-paced**: there are no audio recordings or videos, no submissions, no deadlines of any kind. You can easily follow along with written explanations and code examples at your own speed. This course is also designed for **beginners** and assumes no previous knowledge of programming or any relevant concepts. 

## Course structure
The course is structured as _lessons_ intertwined with _exercises_. Each folder in this repository contains either one lesson or exercises/challenges to support your learning. For complete beginners, I recommend doing the lessons in the order provided, since they build on each other. For those with some previous experience, you can skip around depending on the topics you're interested in.

In each lesson, you have:
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Notebook files, which contain code examples with explanations. 
- .pdf files, which contain additional notes and diagrams.

In each exercise, you have:
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Notebook files which contain the exercise prompts, and additional [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Notebook files with solutions and answers.
- .pdf files, which contain additional explanations of the solutions.

## Advice for learning
### 1. Stay motivated
Remember the wise words of Jake the Dog:

### 2. Practice a little bit every day, it is much better than doing a lot once a month
BLAH BLAH BLAH

### 3. Remember ergonomics

### 4. Use cheat sheets

### 5. Get a rubber duck
