# Painless Introduction to Python: a course
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?


## Who is this for? 
This course was designed for beginners with no previous experience in programming. It is a simple and fairly basic introduction to Python, and it is build as a self-paced learning project. There are no videos or audio recordings, so you can easily follow along with written explanations and code examples. 

## How is this course structured?
The course is structured as lessons. Each folder contains one lesson or activities/programming challenges to support your learning. 
If you have no previous experience with Python, I recommend doing lessons and activities in the order provided. If you have some previous experience, you can skip around depending on the topic that you are interested in exploring. Keep in mind that the course was designed for complete beginners, and the lessons build on each other. 

In each lesson, you have:
- Jupyter Notebook files, which contain code examples with explanations
- .pdf files, which contain additional notes and diagrams

In each activity, you have:
- Jupyter Notebook files, which contain either the challenge or the answers to the challenge
- .pdf files, which contain additional explanations of the answers
